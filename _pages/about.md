Hi there! I am a last-year MSc student at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working at [dlab](https://dlab.epfl.ch/) with [Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/). Currently, I am also a Visiting Fellow at [FBK](https://www.fbk.eu/it/), where I am writing my Thesis with [Riccardo Gallotti](https://chub.fbk.eu/team). Before EPFL, I completed a BSc in Physics at [UniBo](https://www.unibo.it/it).

My research broadly focuses on connecting computational methods and machine learning with society, analyzing large-scale **digital social systems** to provide insights on human behavior and social dynamics. I am particularly interested in political phenomena such as **misinformation** and **polarization**.

Keywords: *Computational Social Science, Natural Language Processing, Network Science, Complex Systems*.

Outside of work, I enjoy [hiking](/assets/img/hiking.jpg), playing [board games](/assets/img/boardgames.jpg), and being an [election forecasting](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-election-forecast/) geek.
